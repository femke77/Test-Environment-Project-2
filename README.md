# Test-Environment-Project-2
For students to test code without depending on other teammates' work to be done. 
No handlebars included. Test JS with basic html. Set up routes as needed. Post.js and Post model
are example files. Update schema.sql with a database name. Create a .env file for your database
info. Sessions and auth not included for faster testing. 
npm i just has the very basics. Include whatever else you need.
